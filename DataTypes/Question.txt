Problem statement
Data type refers to the type of value a variable has and the way the computer interprets it.



Each data type has a different size. You’ve studied 5 different data types and the sizes of the data types:

Integer: 4 bytes
Long: 8 bytes
Float: 4 bytes
Double: 8 bytes
Character: 1 byte


You’re given a data type. Print its size in bytes.



Example :
Input: Long

Output: 8

Explanation: The size of a Long variable is given as 8 bytes.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1:
Long


Sample Output 1:
8


Explanation of sample input 1 :
The size of a Long variable is given as 8 bytes.


Sample Input 2:
Float


Sample Output 2:
4


Explanation of sample input 2 :
The size of a Float variable is given as 4 bytes.


Expected time complexity :
The expected time complexity is O(1).


Constraints :
‘type’ is one of the data types given above.

Time limit: 1 second


Hints:
Use conditional statements (like if-else or switch) to determine the data type provided as input and then print its corresponding size in bytes.
